# merge-stack

Merges all open swarm PRs bottom-up — root PRs first, then their former children, up to the leaves. Before any merge happens, every non-root PR in a multi-PR chain is retargeted to `$BASE` so GitHub never fires its auto-close cascade. Every PR then merges uniformly with `gh pr merge <N> --squash --delete-branch`, and each PR closes its own `Closes/Fixes/Resolves/Refs` references on merge.

Between merges, each still-open downstream branch is locally rebased onto the freshly-updated `$BASE` and force-pushed. Git's patch-id matching drops the predecessor commits (which are already on `$BASE` in squashed form under a different SHA), leaving only the downstream PR's own new commits. Without this rebase, the next PR would flip to `CONFLICTING` the moment its predecessor merges, because the old predecessor commits in its history collide with the new squash commit on `$BASE`.

This matches the merge direction used by Graphite, git-spice, Sapling, and Phabricator: reviewers see and land the same diff, CI runs once per PR instead of re-running on every rebase, and conflicts surface at the leaf instead of cascading down into the root.

## When to use

Run after `/swarm` finishes. All swarm agents have pushed branches and opened PRs; none have merged yet. You've reviewed the PRs and are ready to merge them.

## Process

### 1. Find open swarm PRs

List all open PRs whose head branch starts with `worktree-agent-`:

```bash
gh pr list --state open --json number,title,headRefName,baseRefName,body \
  --jq '.[] | select(.headRefName | startswith("worktree-agent-"))'
```

If no open swarm PRs are found, report "No open swarm PRs found" and stop.

### 2. Build the stack graph

Model the PRs as a directed graph where an edge A → B means "A's head branch is B's base branch" (A sits on top of B). Build this from the `headRefName` / `baseRefName` fields — no issue-body parsing needed for ordering.

Identify:
- **Root PRs**: PRs whose `baseRefName` is `$BASE` (e.g. `develop`) and that have at least one other PR stacked on top — these merge first in their chain.
- **Leaves**: PRs whose `headRefName` is not the `baseRefName` of any other open PR — these are the tops of chains and merge last.
- **Independent PRs**: PRs whose `baseRefName` is already `$BASE` and that no other PR sits on top of — these have no stack relationship and can merge in any order.

For each chain, the merge order is: root → … → leaf (bottom-up).

### 3. Retarget non-root PRs to `$BASE`

For every multi-PR chain, retarget every non-root PR to `$BASE` before merging anything. This neutralizes GitHub's auto-close cascade: once a child's base is `$BASE`, deleting a predecessor's branch on merge no longer looks like abandonment.

```bash
gh pr edit <N> --base $BASE
```

Apply this to every PR in a multi-PR chain except the chain root. Independent PRs already target `$BASE` and need no retargeting. Track the retarget count for the plan preview and final report.

### 4. Present merge plan

Show the plan before proceeding:

```
Merge order (bottom-up per chain):
  Chain 1:  develop ← PR #103 ← PR #104 ← PR #105
  Chain 2:  develop ← PR #108  (independent)

  Retargeted 2 non-root PRs to develop: #104, #105
  Step 1. Merge PR #103 into develop (squash, delete branch)
  Step 2. Rebase #104, #105 onto develop (drop #103's commits via patch-id)
  Step 3. Merge PR #104 into develop (squash, delete branch)
  Step 4. Rebase #105 onto develop (drop #104's commits via patch-id)
  Step 5. Merge PR #105 into develop (squash, delete branch)
  Step 6. Merge PR #108 into develop (squash, delete branch)
```

Proceed immediately.

### 5. Merge bottom-up

For each chain, work from the root up to the leaf. For each PR in order:

#### 5a. Check mergeability

```bash
gh pr view <N> --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus,baseRefName
```

If `mergeStateStatus` is `BEHIND` (or `UNKNOWN` — retry after a short sleep): run the local rebase step from 5e against this branch, then re-check.

#### 5b. Warn on broken closing-keyword footers

Each PR's own body closes its own issues natively on merge, so a malformed footer is silently lossy — the merge succeeds and the trailing refs stay open. Before merging, scan the body for the space-separated form and warn:

```bash
BODY=$(gh pr view <N> --json body --jq '.body')
if printf '%s\n' "$BODY" | grep -qiE '(Closes|Fixes|Resolves) #[0-9]+[[:space:]]+#[0-9]+'; then
  echo "WARNING: PR #<N> body contains a space-separated closing-keyword footer (e.g. 'Closes #A #B #C')." >&2
  echo "GitHub will only auto-close the first ref; the rest will stay open after merge." >&2
  echo "Consider editing the PR body (one 'Closes #N' per line) before merging." >&2
fi
```

Warn-only — do not block. Merge-stack runs after review and the operator may choose to fix the trailing issues by hand.

#### 5c. Merge

Every PR uses the same strategy — uniform squash with branch deletion:

```bash
gh pr merge <N> --squash --delete-branch
```

Each PR's own body closes its own issues natively on merge. No ref injection, no body rewriting.

#### 5d. Conflict handling

If a merge fails with `CONFLICTING`, or if the rebase in 5e fails with a genuine content conflict (not a patch-id-matchable duplicate):
- Stop the chain at this PR
- Report the conflict with the PR number and branch names
- Mark all PRs above it in the same chain as blocked
- Continue with any independent PRs or unrelated chains
- At the end, list all stopped and blocked PRs so the user can resolve and re-run

#### 5e. Rebase downstream PRs before merging the next one

After merging a non-leaf PR in a chain, every still-open downstream PR in that chain has its predecessor's commits in its history under the old (pre-squash) SHAs. `$BASE` now carries the same content under a new squash SHA, so GitHub will flag the next PR as `DIRTY`/`CONFLICTING` even though the content overlap is benign. `gh pr update-branch` cannot resolve this — it fails with `Cannot update PR branch due to conflicts`. A local rebase is required because only `git rebase`'s patch-id matching drops the already-applied commits.

For every still-open PR in the chain, from closest-to-root to leaf:

```bash
git fetch origin <head-branch> $BASE
git checkout <head-branch>
if ! git rebase origin/$BASE; then
  git rebase --abort
  # Real content conflict (e.g. add/add on a file two chains both created).
  # Fall through to 5d: stop this chain, block its dependents, continue with
  # other chains/independents. Do NOT force-push; leave the PR untouched so
  # the user can resolve by hand.
  continue  # or equivalent control flow in the skill's execution loop
fi
git push --force-with-lease origin <head-branch>
```

`git rebase` will emit `warning: skipped previously applied commit <sha>` for each predecessor commit it drops via patch-id — that's the expected happy path, not an error. A non-zero exit from `git rebase` means a real merge conflict git could not auto-resolve; handle it per 5d. Always `git rebase --abort` before falling through so the branch returns to its pre-rebase state and no partial work is pushed.

After the rebases, re-query `mergeStateStatus` for the next PR to merge and proceed to 5c. GitHub may report `UNKNOWN` briefly after a force-push; poll with `sleep 3` until it resolves to `CLEAN`, `BEHIND`, or `DIRTY`.

For independent PRs (no chain), skip this step — they target `$BASE` directly and have no predecessor commits to drop.

#### 5f. Pause between merges

```bash
sleep 3
```

### 6. Sync base branch

After all merges:

```bash
git checkout $BASE
git pull origin $BASE
```

Where `$BASE` is the base branch of the root PRs (typically `develop`).

### 7. Report

```

## Constraints

- Always merge bottom-up (root PRs first, leaves last)
- Always retarget every non-root PR in a multi-PR chain to `$BASE` before merging anything in that chain
- After each non-leaf merge in a chain, always rebase every still-open downstream branch onto `$BASE` locally and force-push before merging the next one — `gh pr update-branch` cannot resolve the squash-history collision
- Use `gh pr merge <N> --squash --delete-branch` for every PR — no per-role strategy matrix
- Never merge into `main` directly — only into `$BASE` (e.g., `develop`)
- Never skip a conflicted chain's dependents — block and report them
- Independent PRs (targeting `$BASE` with nothing stacked on them) may merge in any order
